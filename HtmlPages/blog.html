                <h2 class="same_head">1) Programming Language :-</h2>
                <p class="same_content">To become a good programmer we need to first learn and master any one programming language that we like. We can review multiple languages and learn according to our interest. If you are a newbie developer I would prefer you should begin with python as it is the most simplest programming language with the basic and simplest syntax. Also everyone should learn each and every core concepts in the languages such as data types, size of each data types etc. Given below are some of the languages through which all can go through in which its documentation is given.</p>

                <h2 class="same_head">2) Object Oriented Programming (OOP's) :-</h2>
                <p class="same_content"> Basically Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. This is the concept which have to be known to master any language completely. This includes various sub topics. Also remember that the topics for OOP's may differ for different languages. Please go through the given reference links to learn. The sub topics are mentioned below :- <br><br>

                <h3 class="topic">Topics :-</h3>
                <h4 class="same_subtopic">A) Class And Object :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    Class - A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or fields), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).<br><br>
                    Object - It is an instance of a class. It is created from a class and can use methods defined in the class. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="same_subtopic">B) Encapsulation :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    It is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also restricts access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the data. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="same_subtopic">C) Inheritance :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    It allows a new class (child class) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (parent class). This method promotes the code reusability. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="same_subtopic">D) Inheritance :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    It allows a new class (child class) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (parent class). This method promotes the code reusability. Also there are different types of inheritance like :-<br><br>
                    Single Inheritance - A child class inherits from a single parent class.
                    <br><br>
                    Multiple Inheritance - A child class inherits from more than one parent class. <br><br>
                    Multilevel Inheritance - A child class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class, forming a chain. <br><br>
                    Hierarchial Inheritance - Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class. <br><br>
                    Hybrid Inheritance - A combination of two or more types of inheritance. For example, a mix of single and multiple inheritance. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="same_subtopic">E) Polymorphism :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. There are two methods through which it can be achieved that are method overloading and method overriding. <br><br>
                    Method Overloading - In method overloading, methods must have the same name and different parameters. <br><br>
                    Method Overriding - In method overriding, methods must have the same name and same parameters. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="same_subtopic">F) Abstraction :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. This is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="same_subtopic">G) Constructor And Destructor :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    Constructor - A special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It usually initializes the object's properties. <br><br>
                    Destructor - A special method that is automatically called when an object is destroyed. It usually performs cleanup tasks. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="same_subtopic">H) Interfaces and Abstract Classes :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    Interface - A completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods (methods without a body).<br><br>
                    Abstract Class - A class that cannot be instantiated on its own and can have abstract methods (methods without a body) as well as concrete methods (methods with a body). <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="same_subtopic">I) Access Modifiers :-</h4>
                <p class="same_content">
                    Keywords that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. Types of access specifiers are public , private , protected and default. <br><br>
                    Public - Accessible from anywhere in the program.<br><br>
                    Private - Accessible only within the same class where it is declared. <br><br>
                    Protected - Accessible within the same class, from subclasses (derived classes), and classes in the same package. <br><br>
                    Default - Accessible only within the same package. This is Java-specific and does not exist as a distinct keyword in C++. In Java, it is often referred to as "package-private".

                <h2 class="same_head">3) Data Structure And Algorithms (DSA) :-</h2>
                <p class="same_content"> Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that help in organizing and processing data efficiently. <br><br>
                Data Structures - A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data for various purposes, such as storage, retrieval, and manipulation. <br><br>
                Algorithms - An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. Algorithms are essential in programming as they provide a clear set of instructions for solving problems or performing computations. <br><br>
                A full roadmap is given below how you can start your DSA journey :- </p> <br><br>
